Javascript utility scripts to manage and test content management against Strapi backend for the AWebFactory.com homepage migration from Drupal 6 to fullstack Javascript.

May eventually evolve into command-line CMS cli.

Much of the migration from Drupal 6 is being managed by our own [DurableDrupal Drush scripts](https://github.com/DurableDrupal/drush-migration-scripts), please feel free to check out that repo also.
