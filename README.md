Javascript utility scripts to manage and test content management against Strapi
backend for the AWebFactory.com homepage migration from Drupal 6 to fullstack
Javascript.

May eventually evolve into command-line CMS cli.

Much of the migration from Drupal 6 is being managed by our own
[DurableDrupal Drush scripts](https://github.com/DurableDrupal/drush-migration-scripts),
please feel free to check out that repo also.

Common use for GET:

Create output directory. Then run something like the following (use quotation
marks if using multiple query params):

```bash
node scripts/get-api-request.js articles?name=One | json > output/featured.txt
200 OK

node scripts/get-api-request tags?_limit=1 | json > output/atag.txt
200 OK

node scripts/get-api-request "tags?tagSlug=ajax&tagSlug=kalabox" | json > output/2tags.txt
200 OK
```
